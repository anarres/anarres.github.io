<p>
Some of humanity's most important staple foods must be ground to a powder before they can be eaten.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Wheat is ground into flour which is then baked to make bread.</li>
<li>Maize is ground into cornmeal which is then made into tortillas or tamales.</li>
<li>Yam, a root vegetable which is an important food in West Africa, is dried and then pounded to make pounded yam, which is used in cooking soups and stews. (Language note: in the US the word 'yams' is sometimes used for sweet potatoes, a completely different food from African yams).</li>
<li>Cassava (another root vegetable, also called manioc) is sometimes ground into cassava flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Apart from these staples, many other foods require grinding: peanuts are ground to make peanut butter, sesame seeds are ground to make tahini, coffee beans are roasted and ground to make coffee.
</p>

<p>
Language note: "to grind" is an irregular verb in the past tense, so instead of "yesterday I grinded something", it's "yesterday I ground something".
