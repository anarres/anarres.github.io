Pottery means making pots and other objects out of clay. The potter first shapes the clay, then exposes it to heat over a period of time, which causes the clay to become very hard. The word 'pottery' is most often used for pots, jugs, plates, and other containers or receptacles for food or water; while the word 'ceramic' is used for other types of objects, like water pipes or basins.
</p>

<h2>Clay</h2>

Clay is a type of soil. Most soil contains some clay, usually between 20% and 50%, but you need 100% clay to make pottery. Luckily, deposits of pure clay are abundantly found all over the world.

<h2>Heat turns clay into pottery</h2>

<p>
If clay is shaped and left to dry in the air, the result is something that looks more or less like pottery, but is very fragile; if you squeeze it in your hand it crumbles, and if you get it wet is turns into mud and loses its shape. However, when clay is heated at a high enough temperature it undergoes a chemical change called 'vitrification'; it becomes hard, and no longer dissolves in water. The hotter the temperature, the more intense the vitrification; in general, pottery fired at higher temperature will be harder, shinier and less porous. If clay gets <em>too</em> hot the clays becomes completely vitrified: it melts and loses its shape, and what's left after it cools down is just a lump of shiny, hard materiel.
</p>

<p>
The minimum temperature for firing pottery is about 550°C, while some types of pottery are fired at temperatures as high as FIXME. The time required for pottery to be fired ranges from XXXXX to YYYYY.

<h2>Methods of firing pottery</h2>

<li>
    <p>
    <strong>Open fire: </strong>
    A wood fire can easily reach a temperature of 600°C, so it's possible to fire pottery on an open wood fire. This is probably how the earliest pottery was made, and today some hobbyists make pottery this way.
    </p>

    <p>
    This method of firing pottery has several disadvantages: it uses more wood to achieve a given temperature than pretty much any other method, and it is harder to control the temperature and keep the temperature even throughout the firing process.

        <strong>Kilns: </strong>
        come in many shapes and sizes, but there are some features they all have in common. A kiln is an enclosed space, which could be a small as one meter cubed (or about as high as a person's waist and just as wide) or could be as large as a many-storied building. Its walls are of some material that keeps heat in and doesn't burn, often stone or brick, and there are small openings at the bottom and top so air can flow through. (There is also a larger opening so clay objects and fuel can be loaded in, and so the fired clay objects can later be removed; this opening might be a 'door' on a hinge or it might just a gap that is temporarily blocked up with bricks or rocks when the kiln is in use.
