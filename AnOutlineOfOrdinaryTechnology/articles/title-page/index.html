<h2>Copying and citing</h2>

<p>
To cite an article, put something like this in a prominent place:

<em>"Dry Stone Walling" by anarres, licensed CC BY_NC 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ - from "An Outline of Ordinary Technology" - anarres.github.io/AnOutlineOfOrdinaryTechnology/</em>.

<h2>Non-commercial</h2>

<p>
The 'non-commercial' part of the license just means you can't copy and share this where the primary goal is to make money. It will usually be fine to copy and share this as part of a job you get paid for; a teacher giving out copies to students is fine, and adding an article to a presentation or educational website is fine. On the other hand, you definitely cannot make 'An Outline of Ordinary Technology' into an ebook and sell it on Amazon.
