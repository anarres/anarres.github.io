A windlass is a simple machine used for lifting things; they are often used for lifting water out of wells. A bucket is tied to a long rope which is in turn tied to a horizontal shaft. The shaft has either a wheel or a lever arm fixed on to it at one end. The bucket is lowered by turning the wheel or lever arm, causing the rope to unwind from the shaft. To raise the bucket back up the wheel or lever arm is turned the other way, causing the rope to wind back onto the shaft.
