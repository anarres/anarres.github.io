A windlass is a simple machine used for lifting things, for example, a windlass is often used to lift water from a well. A rope is tied to a bucket on one end, and fixed at the other end to a horizontal axel which has a handle. When the handle is turned in one direction, the rope winds around the axel, raising the bucket; when the handle is turned in the opposite direction, the rope unwinds from the axel, lowering the bucket.
