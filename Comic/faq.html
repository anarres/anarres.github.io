<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<h3>Is this for kids?</h3>

<p>It's for people of any age.</p>

<h3>I'm a teacher, can I use this in my class?</h3>

<p>Sure!</p>

<h3>What's the best way to learn how to use Foofurple COMIC?</h3>

<p>If you hover over a button, after a moment a little message appears that tells you what that button does. Or just try clicking the buttons and typing in the text boxes to see what happens - we promise you won't break it. (If you do break it, just reload the page and it should be fine again.)</p>

<h3>What should I do with the image description?</h3>

<p>If you post your comic on the Internet, post the image description along with it, so that people who find it hard to look at images (for example, people with poor vision, or people who have really tiny screens on their mobile phones) will be able to appreciate it too.</p>

<h3>When I click the faces button nothing happens!</h3>

<p>The faces only work for the human characters, the robots and the squid alien. They don't work for the animals and the white blob characters.</p>

<h3>I can't create a comic with more than 8 panels!</h3>

<p>That's on purpose - the longer your comic gets, the more data your browser has to keep track of and the more likely it is to slow down or freeze. Better to split your comic up into two parts, or maybe even a trilogy.</p>

<h3>Should I save my comic image as PNG or SVG? What's the difference?</h3>

<p>PNG images are widely accepted, so if you want to post your comic on a blog or social networking site, PNG is your best bet.</p>

<p>On the other hand SVG images look better; if you magnify a PNG image it will get blurry, but an SVG image looks just as sharp no matter how big or small you make it.</p>

<h3>But I really want to find a way to make my PNG image less blurry!</h3>

<p>OK then: first save your comic as an SVG file, then open it in pretty much any drawing program, and save or export it as a PNG.</p>

<p>This works with GIMP or Libre Draw, and probably also with most any drawing program, such as MS Paint, Artweaver, or Photoshop.</p>

<p>Why this works: the blurriness is because Foofurple COMIC doesn't know how to do antialiasing. But drawing programs like GIMP do antialiasing automatically.</p>

<p>This trick probably won't work with Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or other vector / SVG drawing programs.</p>

<h3>What do the letters and numbers in the color box mean?</h3>

<p>That's a hex code, a sequence of six numbers or letters that represents a color. For example 000000 is black, FFFFFF is white, FFFF00 is bright yellow and 00FFFF is cyan (greenish blue). It's called hex, or hexadecimal, because unlike regular numbers where there are 10 digits - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 - with hex there are 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.</p>

<!--

<h3>How to I make this whole website bigger or smaller?</h3>

<p><strong>Ctrl +</strong> (hold down the Ctrl key and the + key at the same time) to make everything bigger.</p> 

<p><strong>Ctrl -</strong>  to make everything smaller.</p>

<p>This works for most websites, not just this one.</p>

<h3>Is there an app?</h3>

<p>Not really. Foofurple COMIC only exists in the form you currently see it. It's a web browser app, that is to say, it's an app that only works inside a web browser (like Firefox, Chrome, or Opera).</p>

<p>That being said, Foofurple COMIC does have some features that make it a little bit like a proper app:</p>

<ul>

<li>You don't actually have to be connected to the Internet to use it.</li>

<li>It's designed so that it (hopefully) works well in any device, in any screen size or shape.</li>

<li>In most web browsers you can press F11 to enter full screen mode, where you can't tell you're in a web browser at all. It looks just like a real app! Press F11 again to leave full screen mode.</li>

</ul>
